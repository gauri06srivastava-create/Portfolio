            I completed my schooling from Mercy Memorial School, where I achieved 90% in 10th grade. I pursued 11th and 12th with PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) and Computer Science, securing 80% in 12th grade. This strong foundation in both science and computing has equipped me with analytical and problem-solving skills, which I apply in my web development projects and algorithmic challenges.
